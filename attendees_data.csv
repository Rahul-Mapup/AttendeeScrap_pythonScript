FreightValidate is a Carrier & Freight Broker Identity Verification and Vetting System for Shippers, Freight Brokers, Load-boards, and factoring companies to use to help verify entities are in compliance with regulations and identify past, present, or potential fraudulent or double brokering threats. 

For any Carrier or Broker to be ""FreightValidated"" they must have active Motor Carrier Authority & DOT Number that has been in effect for more than 30 days, (not pending cancellation), have a verified Principal Place of Business (no post office boxes etc), must not have been blocked by other companies or have any reports of fraud or double broker activity. 

Based on several verification datapoints, Carrier & Brokers MC number information will be either “Validated”. or “Not Validated”. Carriers and Brokers may also receive a “Warning “ Or Caution if there are reports of fraudulent actually or blocks by 3 or more companies 

This tool is NOT intended to replace 3rd Party Carrier Verification, Monitoring or Evaluation companies as we do not report on matters of carrier safety compliance, inspection results, driver fitness or mechanical inspection results- 

We highly recommend that all carriers be thoroughly vetted for compliance, safety history, etc., beginning with FreightValidate and continuing the process of vetting the carrier through companies like www.MyCarrierPackets.com or the Company’s Compliance Department protocols

Within the Texas Center, Daniel created the TAMIU Logistechs Living Lab, a research facility focused on improving the efficiency and competitiveness of cross-border trade and transportation through the use of exponential technologies.

Jeremiah Curvers,CEO & Co-Founder at Polysleep,"Raised in a Belgian family with a strong entrepreneurial spirit in furniture and decor, Jeremiah emigrated to Canada at the age of 15. It was only two years later that he founded his first business venture; it was a sign of things to come. His early passion for graphic design and technology led him into digital marketing for major brands, including – at age 24 – a management position at Yellow Pages Group and consulting work with Videotron, Bell, Wawanesa, Cossette, Touché! and others. During these formative years, he began to embrace the notion of disruptive innovation, an idea that innovation by an outsider can eventually replace establish, market-leading firms. This approach inspired him (following a painful back injury – but that’s another story!) to found Polysleep in 2016. And it drives the business to this day. Leveraging state-of-the-art research and development techniques and the latest digital marketing strategies, Polysleep became one of the Globe and Mail’s “Canada’s Top Growing Companies” in 2022, ranking an impressive 39th out of 430 successful businesses. Jeremiah is also a firm believer of walking the talk when it comes to living personal values. Polysleep, as a company, is well known for its environmentally responsible production and “mattress in a box” delivery methods, as well as its support for numerous charities. For his part, Jeremiah is an active member of the Board of Directors for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Montreal and helps other companies as an executive advisor. Jeremiah’s goal is to sleep well at night knowing he’s helping others do the same.",CEO & Co-Founder,"Montreal, QC, Canada"

Michael Mecca,CEO & Founder at PortPro,"Michael Mecca is setting the gold standard for how drayage carriers should operate -- by streamlining workflows and giving carriers best-in-class tools to run their operation from anywhere so they can focus on growing their business in this $50+ billion-dollar market.  Michael created PortPro in 2019 as a one-stop source for carriers who are fed up with the inefficient, manual processes that have plagued the drayage industry.  He built an expert team of drayage experts, technologists, and customer service experts to function as his clients’ outsourced IT department. Michael’s philosophy is for his team to do all the work so carriers can focus on what they do best – moving their loads safely, efficiently, and profitably. According to Michael, “Our job is never done. We will continue to innovate and push the envelope, widening the gap that PortPro's drayage carriers have over their competitors.” Logistics is in Michael’s DNA. Growing up he was always intrigued by technology – and how it could be a solution to the channel complexities carriers (and shippers) deal with every day. He learned the ropes of the drayage industry at Mecca Trucking, his family’s business, while getting his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and government from Villanova University.
He served in just about every job at Mecca Trucking for nearly a decade before starting Axle Technologies, a FMCSA-certified tech innovator offering an electronic logging solution that allows trucking companies to stay compliant with the federal electronic logging mandate. Michael looks forward to PortPro’s future growth as well as working with fellow entrepreneurs and business leaders to explore how technology can transform the drayage industry.",CEO & Founder,
